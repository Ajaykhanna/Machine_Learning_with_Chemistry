# Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry
This repository contains tutorials on using machine learning methods to predict chemical properties. These tutorials represents using ML as tool and not core implementation of any ML method. The goal from these tutorials is to see how ML helps in making better predictions while keep the chemical intuition as the base.
