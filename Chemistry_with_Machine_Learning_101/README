Machine learning can be a difficult concept to understand, especially if you're not familiar with how it can be used to predict chemical properties. For chemists, this can be even more challenging since there aren't any courses that introduce the use of data analytics tools, let alone machine learning programs. That's why I created this GitHub repository to help chemists (like myself) understand the basics of machine learning and its applications in predicting properties like toxicity, solubility, IR frequencies, and hybridization. My aim is to simplify the ML concepts and relate them to chemical intuition, so it's easier to understand and apply.
