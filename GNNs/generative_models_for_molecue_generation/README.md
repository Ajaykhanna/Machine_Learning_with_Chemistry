# Goal-Directed Molecule Generation using Generative Models like GCPN and GraphAF:pill:

ðŸš€ I've recently embarked on an exhilarating journey into the world of generative graph neural networks and the magic of inverse design with AI! ðŸ’¡ Leveraging the power of PyTorch and the TorchDrug library, I've dived deep into tutorials that have illuminated the intricacies of generative GNNs and their transformative potential in molecule generation. ðŸ§ª This repository is a testament to that journey! Here, you'll find Python scripts that showcase the prowess of the Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN) in crafting molecules tailored with specific properties. ðŸŒŸ Our guiding star? Maximizing properties like drug-likeness, captured beautifully by the QED score, and honing in on specific electronic energy types. I'm thrilled about this learning curve and am eager to explore even more in this space! ðŸŒŒ

### Molecule Generation with GCPN - ZINC250k
[Link to Script](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry/blob/f56dff2773dd5b7deaf1e317966810d6de91cfe5/GNNs/molecue_generation/GCPN/pretraining_molecule_generation.ipynb)

This script showcases the use of GCPN on the ZINC250k dataset. The generated molecules are tuned to have properties represented by electronic energy types.

#### How to Run :runner::
```bash
python pretraining_molecule_generation.py
```

### GCPN for pLOGP
[Link to Script](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry/blob/f56dff2773dd5b7deaf1e317966810d6de91cfe5/GNNs/molecue_generation/GCPN/plogp_based_molecule_generation.ipynb)

Property Specific Molecule Generation: GCPN for Reinforcement Learning. 
The script demonstrates molecule generation using GCPN with reinforcement learning. The dataset used is ZINC250k, and the primary goal is molecule generation optimized for properties described by the plogp measure.

How to Run :runner::
```
python pretraining_molecule_generation.py
```

### GCPN for QED - Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness
[Link to Script](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry/blob/f56dff2773dd5b7deaf1e317966810d6de91cfe5/GNNs/molecue_generation/GCPN/qed_based_molecule_generation.ipynb)

In this script, GCPN is applied for generating molecules with a focus on maximizing their drug-likeness, as assessed by the QED score. The ZINC250k dataset is utilized, and the model aims to maximize the QED measure.

How to Run :runner::
```bash
python qed_based_molecule_generation.py
```

### Molecule Generation with GraphAF - ZINC250k
[Link to Script](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry/blob/83faa27e5ed748b316c6d3789555231c7822c866/GNNs/molecue_generation/GraphAF/pretrained_molecule_generation.ipynb)

This script utilizes the Graph Autoregressive Flow (GraphAF) model to generate molecules from the ZINC250k dataset without any specific optimization goal. After defining the model and training parameters, the script trains the model and then generates molecular structures, displaying them in SMILES format.

### GraphAF for pLOGP - Solubility Driven Drug Generation
[Link to Script](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry/blob/83faa27e5ed748b316c6d3789555231c7822c866/GNNs/molecue_generation/GraphAF/plogp_based_molecule_generation.ipynb)

Employing the Graph Autoregressive Flow (GraphAF) model, this script aims to generate molecules optimized for the pLOGP property, a measure of lipophilicity. It loads a pre-trained model, fine-tunes it using reinforcement learning targeting the pLOGP property, and then generates optimized molecular structures, displaying them in SMILES format.

### GraphAF for QED - Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness
[Link to Script](https://github.com/Ajaykhanna/Machine_Learning_with_Chemistry/blob/83faa27e5ed748b316c6d3789555231c7822c866/GNNs/molecue_generation/GraphAF/qed_based_molecule_generation.ipynb)

This script uses the Graph Autoregressive Flow (GraphAF) model to create molecules with a focus on maximizing the Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness (QED) score. It loads a pre-trained model, refines it through reinforcement learning to enhance the QED score, and then constructs molecules optimized for drug-likeness, presenting them in SMILES notation.
